This Task View contains information about to use R and the world wide web together. The base version of R does not ship with many tools for interacting with the web. Thankfully, there are an increasingly large number of tools for interacting with the web. This task view focuses on packages for obtaining web-based data and information, frameworks for building web-based R applications, and online services that can be accessed from R. A list of available packages and functions is presented below, grouped by the type of activity. The [Open Data Task View](https://github.com/ropensci/opendata) provides further discussion of online data sources that can be accessed from R. 

If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or improvements for this Task View, go to GitHub and [submit an issue](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices/issues), or make some changes and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices/pulls). If you can't contribute on GitHub, [send Thomas an email](mailto:thosjleeper@gmail.com). If you have an issue with one of the packages discussed below, please contact the maintainer of that package. If you know of a web service, API, data source, or other online resource that is not yet supported by an R package, consider adding it to [the package development to do list on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices/wiki/ToDo).

Tools for Working with the Web from R
-------------------------------------

**Core Tools For HTTP Requests**

There are two packages that should cover most use cases of interacting with the web from R. <pkg>httr</pkg> provides a user-friendly interface for executing HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE, etc.) and provides support for modern web authentication protocols (OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0). HTTP status codes are helpful for debugging HTTP calls. httr makes this easier using, for example, `stop_for_status()`, which gets the http status code from a response object, and stops the function if the call was not successful. (See also `warn_for_status()`.) Note that you can pass in additional libcurl options to the `config` parameter in http calls. <pkg>RCurl</pkg> is a lower-level package that provides a closer interface between R and the [libcurl C library](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/), but is less user-friendly. It may be useful for operations on web-based XML or to perform FTP operations. For more specific situations, the following resources may be useful:

-   <pkg>curl</pkg> is another libcurl client that provides the `curl()` function as an SSL-compatible replacement for base R's `url()` and support for http 2.0, ssl (https, ftps), gzip, deflate and more. For websites serving insecure HTTP (i.e. using the "http" not "https" prefix), most R functions can extract data directly, including `read.table` and `read.csv`; this also applies to functions in add-on packages such as `jsonlite::fromJSON` and `XML::parseXML`. <pkg>httpRequest</pkg> is another low-level package for HTTP requests that implements the GET, POST and multipart POST verbs.
-   <pkg>request</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/sckott/request)) provides a high-level package that is useful for developing other API client packages. <pkg>httping</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/sckott/httping)) provides simplified tools to ping and time HTTP requests, around httr calls. <pkg>httpcache</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/nealrichardson/httpcache)) provides a mechanism for caching HTTP requests.
-   For dynamically generated webpages (i.e., those requiring user interaction to display results), <pkg>RSelenium</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium/)) can be used to automate those interactions and extract page contents. It provides a set of bindings for the Selenium 2.0 webdriver using the [JsonWireProtocol](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol). It can also aid in automated application testing, load testing, and web scraping. [rdom](https://github.com/cpsievert/rdom) (not on CRAN) uses [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) to access a webpage's Document Object Model (DOM).
-   Another, higher-level alternative package useful for webscraping is <pkg>rvest</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/hadley/rvest)), which is designed to work with <pkg>magrittr</pkg> to make it easy to express common web scraping tasks.
-   Many base R tools can be used to download web content, provided that the website does not use SSL (i.e., the URL does not have the "https" prefix). `download.file()` is a general purpose function that can be used to download a remote file. For SSL, the `download()` function in <pkg>downloader</pkg> wraps `download.file()`, and takes all the same arguments.
-   Tabular data sets (e.g., txt, csv, etc.) can be input using `read.table()`, `read.csv()`, and friends, again assuming that the files are not hosted via SSL. An alternative is to use `httr::GET` (or `RCurl::getURL`) to first read the file into R as a character vector before parsing with `read.table(text=...)`, or you can download the file to a local directory. <pkg>rio</pkg> ([GitHub](https://www.github.com/leeper/rio)) provides an `import()` function that can read a number of common data formats directly from an https:// URL. The <pkg>repmis</pkg> function `source_data()` can load and cache plain-text data from a URL (either http or https). That package also includes `source_Dropbox()` for downloading/caching plain-text data from non-public Dropbox folders and `source_XlsxData()` for downloading/caching Excel xlsx sheets.
-   *Authentication*: Using web resources can require authentication, either via API keys, OAuth, username:password combination, or via other means. Additionally, sometimes web resources that require authentication be in the header of an http call, which requires a little bit of extra work. API keys and username:password combos can be combined within a url for a call to a web resource (api key: http://api.foo.org/?key=yourkey; user/pass: http://username:password@api.foo.org), or can be specified via commands in <pkg>RCurl</pkg> or <pkg>httr</pkg>. OAuth is the most complicated authentication process, and can be most easily done using <pkg>httr</pkg>. See the 6 demos within <pkg>httr</pkg>, three for OAuth 1.0 (linkedin, twitter, vimeo) and three for OAuth 2.0 (facebook, GitHub, google). <pkg>ROAuth</pkg> is a package that provides a separate R interface to OAuth. OAuth is easier to to do in <pkg>httr</pkg>, so start there. [googleAuthR](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleAuthR) provides an OAuth 2.0 setup specifically for Google web services.

**Parsing Structured Web Data**

The vast majority of web-based data is structured as plain text, HTML, XML, or JSON (javascript object notation). Web service APIs increasingly rely on JSON, but XML is still prevalent in many applications. There are several packages for specifically working with these format. These functions can be used to interact directly with insecure webpages or can be used to parse locally stored or in-memory web files.

-   *XML/HTML*: There are two packages for working with XML: <pkg>XML</pkg> and <pkg>xml2</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/hadley/xml2)). Both support general XML (and HTML) parsing, including XPath queries. The package <pkg>xml2</pkg> is less fully featured, but more user friendly with respect to memory management, classes (e.g., XML node vs. node set vs. document), and namespaces. Of the two, only the <pkg>XML</pkg> supports *de novo* creation of XML nodes and documents. The <pkg>XML2R</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/cpsievert/XML2R)) package is a collection of convenient functions for coercing XML into data frames. An alternative to <pkg>XML</pkg> is [selectr](http://sjp.co.nz/projects/selectr/), which parses CSS3 Selectors and translates them to XPath 1.0 expressions. <pkg>XML</pkg> package is often used for parsing xml and html, but [selectr](http://sjp.co.nz/projects/selectr/) translates CSS selectors to XPath, so can use the CSS selectors instead of XPath. The [selectorgadget browser extension](http://selectorgadget.com/) can be used to identify page elements. <ohat>RHTMLForms</ohat> reads HTML documents and obtains a description of each of the forms it contains, along with the different elements and hidden fields. <pkg>scrapeR</pkg> provides additional tools for scraping data from HTML and XML documents. [htmltab](http://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib/Archive/htmltab/) extracts structured information from HTML tables, similar to `XML::readHTMLTable` of the <pkg>XML</pkg> package, but automatically expands row and column spans in the header and body cells, and users are given more control over the identification of header and body rows which will end up in the R table.
-   *JSON*: There are three packages for reading and writing JSON: <pkg>rjson</pkg>, <pkg>RJSONIO</pkg>, and <pkg>jsonlite</pkg>. <pkg>jsonlite</pkg> includes a different parser from <pkg>RJSONIO</pkg> called [yajl](https://lloyd.github.io/yajl/). We recommend using <pkg>jsonlite</pkg>. Check out the paper describing jsonlite by Jeroen Ooms <http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2805>. <pkg>tidyjson</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/sailthru/tidyjson)) converts JSON into a data.frame.

**Tools for Working with URLs**

-   The `httr::parse_url()` function can be used to extract portions of a URL. The `RCurl::URLencode()` and `utils::URLencode()` functions can be used to encode character strings for use in URLs. `utils::URLdecode()` decodes back to the original strings. <pkg>urltools</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/Ironholds/urltools)) can also handle URL encoding, decoding, parsing, and parameter extraction.
-   The [tldextract](https://github.com/jayjacobs/tldextract) package extract top level domains and subdomains from a host name. It's a port of [a Python library of the same name](https://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextract).
-   [iptools](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/iptools) can facilitate working with IPv4 addresses, including for use in geolocation.
-   <pkg>urlshorteneR</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/dmpe/urlshorteneR)) offers URL expansion and analysis for Bit.ly, Goo.gl, and is.gd. <pkg>longurl</pkg> uses the [longurl.org](http://longurl.org/) API to provide similar functionality.

**Tools for Working with Scraped Webpage Contents**

-   Several packages can be used for parsing HTML documents. <pkg>boilerpipeR</pkg> provides generic extraction of main text content from HTML files; removal of ads, sidebars and headers using the boilerpipe Java library. <ohat>RTidyHTML</ohat> interfaces to the libtidy library for correcting HTML documents that are not well-formed. This library corrects common errors in HTML documents. <pkg>W3CMarkupValidator</pkg> provides an R Interface to W3C Markup Validation Services for validating HTML documents.
-   For XML documents, the <ohat>XMLSchema</ohat> package provides facilities in R for reading XML schema documents and processing them to create definitions for R classes and functions for converting XML nodes to instances of those classes. It provides the framework for meta-computing with XML schema in R. [xslt](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/xslt) is a package providing an interface to the [xmlwrapp](http://vslavik.github.io/xmlwrapp/) an XML processing library that provides an XSLT engine for transforming XML data using a transform stylesheet. (It can be seen as a modern replacement for <ohat>Sxslt</ohat>, which is an interface to Dan Veillard's libxslt translator, and the <ohat>SXalan</ohat> package.) This may be useful for webscraping, as well as transforming XML markup into another human- or machine-readable format (e.g., HTML, JSON, plain text, etc.). <ohat>SSOAP</ohat> provides a client-side SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) mechanism. It aims to provide a high-level interface to invoke SOAP methods provided by a SOAP server. <ohat>XMLRPC</ohat> provides an implementation of XML-RPC, a relatively simple remote procedure call mechanism that uses HTTP and XML. This can be used for communicating between processes on a single machine or for accessing Web services from within R.
-   <ohat>Rcompression</ohat> (not on CRAN): Interface to zlib and bzip2 libraries for performing in-memory compression and decompression in R. This is useful when receiving or sending contents to remote servers, e.g. Web services, HTTP requests via RCurl.
-   <pkg>tm.plugin.webmining</pkg>: Extensible text retrieval framework for news feeds in XML (RSS, ATOM) and JSON formats. Currently, the following feeds are implemented: Google Blog Search, Google Finance, Google News, NYTimes Article Search, Reuters News Feed, Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Inplay.
-   <pkg>webshot</pkg> uses [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) to provide screenshots of web pages without a browser. It can be useful for testing websites (such as Shiny applications).

**Other Useful Packages and Functions**

-   *Javascript*: <pkg>V8</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/jeroenooms/v8)) is an R interface to Google's open source, high performance JavaScript engine. It can wrap Javascript libraries as well as NPM packages. The <ohat>SpiderMonkey</ohat> package provides another means of evaluating JavaScript code, creating JavaScript objects and calling JavaScript functions and methods from within R. This can work by embedding the JavaScript engine within an R session or by embedding R in an browser such as Firefox and being able to call R from JavaScript and call back to JavaScript from R.
-   *Email:*: <pkg>mailR</pkg> is an interface to Apache Commons Email to send emails from within R. <pkg>sendmailR</pkg> provides a simple SMTP client. <pkg>gmailr</pkg> provides access the Google's gmail.com RESTful API.
-   *Miscellaneous*: <pkg>webutils</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/jeroenooms/webutils)) contains various functions for developing web applications, including parsers for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` as well as `multipart/form-data`. <pkg>mime</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/yihui/mime)) guesses the MIME type for a file from its extension. <pkg>rsdmx</pkg> ([GitHub](https://github.com/opensdmx/rsdmx/wiki)) provides tools to read data and metadata documents exchanged through the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX) framework. The package currently focuses on the SDMX XML standard format (SDMX-ML).
