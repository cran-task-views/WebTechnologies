        This Task View contains information about to use R and the world wide web together. The base version of R does not ship with many tools for interacting with the web. Thankfully, there are an increasingly large number of tools for interacting with the web. This task view focuses on packages for obtaining web-based data and information, frameworks for building web-based R applications, and online services that can be accessed from R. A list of available packages and functions is presented below, grouped by the type of activity. The
        <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/opendata">
          Open Data Task View
        </a>
        provides further discussion of online data sources that can be accessed from R.

        Tools for Working with the Web from R
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Core Tools For HTTP Requests
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two packages that should cover most use cases of interacting with the web from R.
<a href="../packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>
        provides a user-friendly interface for executing HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE, etc.) and provides support for modern web authentication protocols (OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0). HTTP status codes are helpful for debugging HTTP calls. httr makes this easier using, for example,
<tt>stop_for_status()</tt>, which gets the http status code from a response object, and stops the function if the call was not successful. (See also
<tt>warn_for_status()</tt>.) Note that you can pass in additional libcurl options to the
<tt>config</tt>
        parameter in http calls.
<a href="../packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a>
        is a lower-level package that provides a closer interface between R and the
        <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">
          libcurl C library
        </a>, but is less user-friendly. It may be useful for operations on web-based XML or to perform FTP operations. For more specific situations, the following resources may be useful:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a href="../packages/curl/index.html">curl</a>
          is another libcurl client that provides the
<tt>curl()</tt>
          function as an SSL-compatible replacement for base R's
<tt>url()</tt>
          and support for http 2.0, ssl (https, ftps), gzip, deflate and more. For websites serving insecure HTTP (i.e. using the &quot;http&quot; not &quot;https&quot; prefix), most R functions can extract data directly, including
<tt>read.table</tt>
          and
<tt>read.csv</tt>; this also applies to functions in add-on packages such as
<tt>jsonlite::fromJSON</tt>
          and
<tt>XML::parseXML</tt>.
<a href="../packages/httpRequest/index.html">httpRequest</a>
          is another low-level package for HTTP requests that implements the GET, POST and multipart POST verbs.
        </li>
        <li>
          For dynamically generated webpages (i.e., those requiring user interaction to display results),
<a href="../packages/RSelenium/index.html">RSelenium</a>
          (
          <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium/">
            GitHub
          </a>) can be used to automate those interactions and extract page contents. It provides a set of bindings for the Selenium 2.0 webdriver using the
          <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol">
            JsonWireProtocol
          </a>. It can also aid in automated application testing, load testing, and web scraping.
          <a href="https://github.com/cpsievert/rdom">
            rdom
          </a>
          (not on CRAN) uses
          <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">
            phantomjs
          </a>
          to access a webpage's Document Object Model (DOM).
        </li>
        <li>
          Another, higher-level alternative package useful for webscraping is
<a href="../packages/rvest/index.html">rvest</a>
          (
          <a href="https://github.com/hadley/rvest">
            GitHub
          </a>), which is designed to work with
<a href="../packages/magrittr/index.html">magrittr</a>
          to make it easy to express common web scraping tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many base R tools can be used to download web content, provided that the website does not use SSL (i.e., the URL does not have the &quot;https&quot; prefix).
<tt>download.file()</tt>
          is a general purpose function that can be used to download a remote file. For SSL, the
<tt>download()</tt>
          function in
<a href="../packages/downloader/index.html">downloader</a>
          wraps
<tt>download.file()</tt>, and takes all the same arguments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tabular data sets (e.g., txt, csv, etc.) can be input using
<tt>read.table()</tt>,
<tt>read.csv()</tt>, and friends, again assuming that the files are not hosted via SSL. An alternative is to use
<tt>httr::GET</tt>
          (or
<tt>RCurl::getURL</tt>) to first read the file into R as a character vector before parsing with
<tt>read.table(text=...)</tt>, or you can download the file to a local directory.
<a href="../packages/rio/index.html">rio</a>
          (
          <a href="https://www.github.com/leeper/rio">
            GitHub
          </a>) provides an
<tt>import()</tt>
          function that can read a number of common data formats directly from an https:// URL. The
<a href="../packages/repmis/index.html">repmis</a>
          function
<tt>source_data()</tt>
          can load and cache plain-text data from a URL (either http or https). That package also includes
<tt>source_Dropbox()</tt>
          for downloading/caching plain-text data from non-public Dropbox folders and
<tt>source_XlsxData()</tt>
          for downloading/caching Excel xlsx sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            Authentication
          </em>: Using web resources can require authentication, either via API keys, OAuth, username:password combination, or via other means. Additionally, sometimes web resources that require authentication be in the header of an http call, which requires a little bit of extra work. API keys and username:password combos can be combined within a url for a call to a web resource (api key: http://api.foo.org/?key=yourkey; user/pass: http://username:password@api.foo.org), or can be specified via commands in
<a href="../packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a>
          or
<a href="../packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>. OAuth is the most complicated authentication process, and can be most easily done using
<a href="../packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>. See the 6 demos within
<a href="../packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>, three for OAuth 1.0 (linkedin, twitter, vimeo) and three for OAuth 2.0 (facebook, GitHub, google).
<a href="../packages/ROAuth/index.html">ROAuth</a>
          is a package that provides a separate R interface to OAuth. OAuth is easier to to do in
<a href="../packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>, so start there.
          <a href="https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleAuthR">
            googleAuthR
          </a>

        <strong>
          Parsing Structured Web Data
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The vast majority of web-based data is structured as plain text, HTML, XML, or JSON (javascript object notation). Web service APIs increasingly rely on JSON, but XML is still prevalent in many applications. There are several packages for specifically working with these format. These functions can be used to interact directly with insecure webpages or can be used to parse locally stored or in-memory web files.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>
            XML/HTML
          </em>: There are two packages for working with XML:
<a href="../packages/XML/index.html">XML</a>
          and
<a href="../packages/xml2/index.html">xml2</a>
          (
          <a href="https://github.com/hadley/xml2">
            GitHub
          </a>). Both support general XML (and HTML) parsing, including XPath queries. The package
<a href="../packages/xml2/index.html">xml2</a>
          is less fully featured, but more user friendly with respect to memory management, classes (e.g., XML node vs. node set vs. document), and namespaces. Of the two, only the
<a href="../packages/XML/index.html">XML</a>
          supports
          <em>
            de novo
          </em>
          creation of XML nodes and documents. The
<a href="../packages/XML2R/index.html">XML2R</a>
          (
          <a href="https://github.com/cpsievert/XML2R">
            GitHub
          </a>) package is a collection of convenient functions for coercing XML into data frames. An alternative to
<a href="../packages/XML/index.html">XML</a>
          is
          <a href="http://sjp.co.nz/projects/selectr/">
            selectr
          </a>, which parses CSS3 Selectors and translates them to XPath 1.0 expressions.
<a href="../packages/XML/index.html">XML</a>
          package is often used for parsing xml and html, but
          <a href="http://sjp.co.nz/projects/selectr/">
            selectr
          </a>
          translates CSS selectors to XPath, so can use the CSS selectors instead of XPath. The
          <a href="http://selectorgadget.com/">
            selectorgadget browser extension
          </a>
          can be used to identify page elements.
<a href="http://www.Omegahat.org/RHTMLForms/"><span class="Ohat">RHTMLForms</span></a>
          reads HTML documents and obtains a description of each of the forms it contains, along with the different elements and hidden fields.
<a href="../packages/scrapeR/index.html">scrapeR</a>
          provides additional tools for scraping data from HTML and XML documents.
          <a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib/Archive/htmltab/">
            htmltab
          </a>
          extracts structured information from HTML tables, similar to
<tt>XML::readHTMLTable</tt>
          of the
<a href="../packages/XML/index.html">XML</a>
          package, but automatically expands row and column spans in the header and body cells, and users are given more control over the identification of header and body rows which will end up in the R table.

        <li>
          <em>
            JSON
          </em>: There are three packages for reading and writing JSON:
